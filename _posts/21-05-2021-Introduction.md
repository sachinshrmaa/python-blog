### 1.1 About this website

Python for all is aimed to help students and enginners learn version 3 Python programming language and its associated libraries.

No prior programming experience or scientific knowledge in any par- ticular field is assumed. 

**[ Recommended ]** -  Familiarity with some mathematical concepts such as trigonometry, complex numbers and basic calculus is helpful to follow the examples and exercises.


### 1.2 Introduction to Python

Python is a highlevel general purpose programming language. It was designed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991as Python 0.9.0.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

In this entire tutorial we learn **Python3**, It was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the langauge that is not completely backward-compatible and much python2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python2 was discontiued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
